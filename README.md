# MITXProblemset3
##### Part of the problem sets of the MIT course Entitled Introduction to computational thinking and datascience


## Summary
In this problem, I used the principles of the Monte-carlo simulation to mimic the growth of a virus in a patient; and the effect of drugs on the growth rate of said virus.

## Libraries
pylab was used to generate basic plots
numpy was used to run computations the multidimensional arrays for the simulation

To view this code in action: install anaconda, and the plots will work fine.
